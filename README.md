# E-Commerce Shipping Prediction Using Machine Learning

## Project Overview
This project aims to predict the shipping time category for e-commerce orders using machine learning. By analyzing historical order data and shipping details, the model can help businesses optimize logistics and improve customer satisfaction.

The project demonstrates the full data science workflow:
- Data collection and cleaning
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature engineering
- Model selection and training
- Model evaluation
- Insights and visualizations

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains historical e-commerce order details, including:
- Order IDs
- Customer information
- Product details
- Shipping details
- Delivery times



---

## Tools & Libraries
The project is implemented in **Python** and uses the following libraries:
- `pandas` – Data manipulation
- `numpy` – Numerical operations
- `matplotlib` & `seaborn` – Data visualization
- `scikit-learn` – Machine learning models and evaluation
-  Logistic Regression
-  Random Forest Classifier
-  Decision Tree Classifier

## Workflow
1. **Data Import & Cleaning:** Handling missing values, outliers, and inconsistent data.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Understanding patterns and relationships between features.
3. **Feature Engineering:** Encoding categorical variables and creating meaningful features.
4. **Model Training & Selection:** Training models 
5. **Model Evaluation:** Using accuracy, ROC curve, and other metrics to assess model performance.
6. **Prediction:** Predicting shipping time categories for new orders.
7. **Visualization:** Presenting insights and feature importance using graphs.
